        "text": "In this post, I'm going to show you how to configure an Immutant                 cluster as a Datomic storage service and test it with an example                 application. Datomic prescribes a unique architecture in which database concepts                 -- transactions, queries, and storage -- are separated. It                 treats external storage engines much the same way a traditional                 database treats a file system. And one of its supported engines is                 Infinispan, which just so happens to be included in Immutant! But there's a catch. Immutant only provides in-process access to                 Infinispan. And the Datomic transactor is a standalone                 application meant to run in its own process, so it expects to access                 Infinispan via a HotRod server, which is not provided by Immutant...                                  ...until now! As of version 1.1.0 of the lein-immutant plugin, it's possible to                 overlay...",

This is true in fields from industry to government to media to academia and virtually everywhere in between. Our increasing abilities to gather, process, visualize, and learn from large datasets is helping to push the boundaries of our knowledge.\n\nBut where scientific research is concerned, this recently accelerated shift to data-centric science has a dark side, which boils down to this: the skills required to be a successful scientific researcher are increasingly indistinguishable from the skills required to be successful in industry. While academia, with typical inertia, gradually shifts to accommodate this, the rest of the world has already begun to embrace and reward these skills to a much greater degree. The unfortunate result is that some of the most promising upcoming researchers are finding no place for themselves...",

Along with the huge library of archived webpages, ebooks, movies, and music, it now offers an in-browser emulator that will allow you to run classic games and old programs inside the browser. So, if you get hit by nostalgia you can fire it up and play classic games like PAC-MAN, Adventureland, and The Hobbit among others. The not-for-profit organization has also curated the Historical Software Collection, with selective picks of historically significant software in one place.The rapid pace set by technology makes applications and games obsolete very fast; sometimes, even before you can appreciate it fully. Some become collector\u2019s items and inaccessible to the general public. The Javascript MESS emulator introduced by the Internet Archive just needs a browser to dial back the time for you. If you started learning on something like WordStar or Visicalc, then your wish to try them out for old time\u2019s sake could be answered...",

Elasticsearch and Hortonworks have strengthened their relationship by formally partnering up, which has resulted in Elasticsearch now being the first certified Hortonworks Apache YARN search vendor. With both Elasticsearch and Hortonworks being leaders in the open source space, this partnership will lead to a valuable integration between Elasticsearch and Hadoop that anyone using the open source products will benefit from.\n\nThis is what Hortonworks said about our newly formed partnership: \u201CThe over 400,000 downloads a month is a testament to the level of trust put into Elasticsearch. Since Elasticsearch and Hadoop are such critical elements to the data analytics infrastructure for a huge number of users, we\u2019re excited by this opportunity to join together and reach beyond our users\u2019 expectations.\u201D Shaun Conolly, Vice President, Corporate Strategy at Hortonworks Elasticsearch\u2019s real-time data exploration, analytics, logging...",

Make sure that you tackle these first every day. Highly effective people plan their work and then work their plan. They make sure that they work first on the critical items and do not although themselves to get sidetracked with less important issues.2.  Agree your priorities with your boss. Sit down with your manager on a regular basis to discuss your workload and objectives, and get him or her to agree the top priorities.

Not just because its partners of us offering a service based on Hadoop, but because it shows how Hadoop integration with OpenStack has reached a point where it\u2019s ready for production use. And because to get to that state the Hadoop and OpenStack development communities had to work together.\n\nI can only vouch for one part of the collaboration, the OpenStack Swift FileSystem client for Apache Hadoop. As customers run their applications in the public cloud, object stores like Swift are being used for data backup and long term archival. This new client allows Hadoop applications \u2013 including MapReduce, Pig and Hive Queries to work with data stored...",

One of the big data software startups riding Hadoop is the San Francisco company Splice Machine, which claims to have built the industry's first real-time, transactional, SQL-on-Hadoop database.\n\nHadoop rose to prominence several years ago for its capability to run massively parallel analytic workloads in a batch environment. Today we're seeing Hadoop evolve in other directions, especially with the advent of the HBase NoSQL database that can ride atop Hadoop and provide real-time transactional capabilities. SQL is also getting bigger on Hadoop through Hive and other open source and commercial projects.\n\nBut according to the folks at Splice Machine, what the market really needs is a way to bring all these capabilities together in seamless manner. If Hadoop is going to be the center of the big data universe--and it certainly seems to be...",

Scan the entire scene, and it mostly looks like a video game gone horribly awry. The essential data, though is intact. This is a 3D satellite view of New York City, expressed in two dimensions, from Valla's wonderfully disorienting web project \"3D maps minus the 3D.\" You're looking at visual data meant to be processed by computers in re-assembling three-dimensional aerial views from satellite data for online platforms you might more readily recognize, like Google Satellite. The result, not necessarily intended for human consumption, is part kaleidoscope, part cubist art, part commentary on the omnipotent aerial view of cities.

Let\u2019s start first with an overview of the Splunk \u2018predict\u2019 command.\n\nThe \u2018predict\u2019 command in Splunk assists users in visualizing a 95th percentile \u201Cband of normalcy\u201D around a value of a data series over time. In addition to this visualization, one can also follow the instructions outlined in this Splunk blog article to potentially drive alerts when the actual value of the data series falls outside of the \u201Cband of normalcy\u201D. This is like setting thresholds in advance for alerts.\n\nI applied the blog\u2019s recommended usage of \u2018predict\u2019 against some representative response time data (available here) to test the results: sourcetype=\u201Dfarequote\u201D airline=AAL | timechart span=1m max(responsetime) as resptime...",

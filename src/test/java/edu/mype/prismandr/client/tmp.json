The author admits to having no Scala code in mission critical production, and would like to mention that he has lots of opinions about many things in which his expertise can be contested ;-) Super fast intro \u2013 Why should I know about Scala?\n\nScala is a relatively-new, statically-typed programming language that mixes object-oriented and functional programming on the JVM. It has been getting more and more popular, because it is probably the best alternative to Java there is at the moment and has a rich type system which lets you do crazy stuff if you really want. But, as I will explain, there are some drawbacks that can detract from these benefits.\n\nIf you are a Java developer and want to get a quick intro to Scala, Daniel Spiewak wrote a good series of posts for you: Scala for Java Refugees.\n\nStay close to the shallow end?\n\nThere have been numerous blog posts during the...",

Inside an existing company of some two hundred staff, I needed to assemble a small team, and create a business that is meaningful to a company of Envato's size. With just six months to do it, I decided  immediately that Lean would give us the best chance of success. We would build, measure and learn. But just as importantly, we'd constantly challenge our thinking,  and be ready to change, pivot and adapt when needed. And we'd keep doing it until we found product-market fit.\n\nSix months later we had a live product making sales, and six months after that we're at a million dollar run-rate revenue and growing fast.

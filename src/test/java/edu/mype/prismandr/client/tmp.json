Instead, they went to a group of competitors\u2014Microsoft, Apple, RIM, Ericsson, and Sony\u2014operating under the name \"Rockstar Bidco.\" The companies together bid the shocking sum of $4.5 billion.\n\nPatent insiders knew that the Nortel portfolio was the patent equivalent of a nuclear stockpile: dangerous in the wrong hands, and a bit scary even if held by a \"responsible\" party.\n\nThis afternoon, that stockpile was finally used for what pretty much everyone suspected it would be used for\u2014launching an all-out patent attack on Google and Android. The smartphone patent wars have been underway for a few years now, and the eight lawsuits filed in federal court today by Rockstar Consortium mean that the conflict just hit DEFCON 1.  Google probably knew this...",

The graph has 1 million vertices and 4  million edges. The degree distribution of this graph on a log-log plot is provided below. A visualization of a 1,000 vertex subset of the graph is diagrammed above.\n\nLoading the Graph The graph data set was loaded both into MySQL and Neo4j. In MySQL a single table was used with the following schema.CREATE TABLE graph (   outV INT NOT NULL,   inV INT NOT NULL ); CREATE INDEX outV_index USING BTREE ON graph (outV); CREATE INDEX inV_index USING BTREE ON graph (inV);After loading the data, the table appears as below.

Without further introduction, I will give you the five faults of a software engineer:There are five dangerous faults, which may effect to a software engineer:Recklessness, which leads to destruction. If a software engineer is reckless, his quality of work will be considerable lower than the quality of work done by software engineers, who think before they act. Reckless people tend to make a lot of mistakes and some of them might be very expensive to fix. Even though a reckless software engineer would not make expensive mistakes, he will nevertheless spent his time to fix mistakes, which could have been easily avoided. Remember that it is almost always wise to think before you act.Cowardice, which leads to capture. If a software engineer is desperate...",

We briefly discussed it internally at Cloudera, and I thought I\u2019d share what I contributed, below. There\u2019s an underlying theme here regarding the role of distributed systems research in practitioners\u2019 daily work, and how the act of building a distributed system has not yet been sufficiently well commoditised to render a familiarity with the original research unnecessary. I think I\u2019d argue that bridging that gap further is necessary: no matter how much fun it is to read all these papers, it shouldn\u2019t be a pre-requisite to being successful in implementing a distributed system. I have more to write on this. \u201CThe trouble with Paxos is that it\u2019s \u2018only\u2019 a consensus algorithm; a theoretical achievement but not one necessarily suited to building practical systems. Remember that the demonstration that a correct, message-optimal protocol even existed was the main contribution. To...",
